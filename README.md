# Farmito
ðŸ‘‰Farmito delivers farm products to customers directly from the nearest farm/farmers, as a result, the customer gets fresh food  and the farmers get the direct profit without any need for traditional middleman involvement.
<br/> ðŸ‘‰An e-Commerce application towards sustainability.

## Inspiration
* In this modern era where people are busy in their work life going to the market to purchase vegetables, fruits, dairy, eggs, etc is a tiring and time-consuming task. Also, the quality is compromised. The health of people is in danger due to the daily consumption of preserved food items. In that case, fresh food at reasonable prices is high in demand. 

* TheÂ **Indian farmer** is a living idol of India, as they are the most hardworking farmers around the world & always busy, working hard for their crops, during day and night. But the sad part is they donâ€™t get the desired profit out of it. Itâ€™s the middleman who makes the most of the profit and consumers have to pay more than the actual price.

## What it does
* Our team has approached to design a solution where the customer himself chooses the farmer available in their nearest farm, places an order and a delivery partner delivers farm products directly to the doorsteps of customers at a reasonable price and the money will be transferred directly to the farmer's account.

## How we built it
* Figma: We started with a basic prototype of our entire idea. We built our mobile and web application prototype in figma. <br/>
* Velo by Wix: To save our time we developed and hosted our website in wix. 
* Machine Learning: Location based Recommendation system.(K-mean clustering algorithm is used)

## Buisiness Model

## Challenges we ran into
* As a front-end developed I usually develop my websites in React.js, for the first time I used Velo by wix to design the website, initially it was challenging to understand it's interface.
* Faced challenging to integrate the embedded iframe code in wix, infact could not fix it hence had to design it from scratch.
* Data cleaning
* Time constraints

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* We could come up with a solution that not only a potential start-up plan, but it can solve a major farmer issues. Unlike traditional middle man involvement the money will directly get into farmers account from the customer.
* It fullfills 2030 Sustainabiity goals.
* We could implement a raw idea into code.
* Our buisiness model

## What we learned
* Amazing tools and technolgies.
* Chat API of Twilio
* velo by Wix
* Teamwork
* Time management

## What's next for Farmito
* We want to take forward our project to a large scale software development model
* We will add more functionalities to it so as to make it a real time application.
* We would like to develop mobile application using Flutter.
* GPI system is to added

# Farmito
ðŸ‘‰Farmito delivers farm products to customers directly from the nearest farm/farmers, as a result, the customer gets fresh food  and the farmers get the direct profit without any need for traditional middleman involvement.
ðŸ‘‰An e-Commerce application towards sustainability.

## Inspiration
* In this modern era where people are busy in their work life going to the market to purchase vegetables, fruits, dairy, eggs, etc is a tiring and time-consuming task. Also, the quality is compromised. The health of people is in danger due to the daily consumption of preserved food items. In that case, fresh food at reasonable prices is high in demand. 

* TheÂ **Indian farmer** is a living idol of India, as they are the most hardworking farmers around the world & always busy, working hard for their crops, during day and night. But the sad part is they donâ€™t get the desired profit out of it. Itâ€™s the middleman who makes the most of the profit and consumers have to pay more than the actual price.

## What it does
* Our team has approached to design a solution where the customer himself chooses the farmer available in their nearest farm, places an order and a delivery partner delivers farm products directly to the doorsteps of customers at a reasonable price and the money will be transferred directly to the farmer's account.
